# Tally: Non-Intrusive Performance Isolation for GPUs

Tally is a non-intrusive GPU sharing mechanism that provides robust performance isolation and seamless workload compatibility. It employs block-level GPU kernel scheduling to mitigate interference from workload co-execution, ensuring high-priority tasks (e.g., real-time inference) can effectively maintain their performance when sharing GPUs with best-effort workloads (e.g., training).
